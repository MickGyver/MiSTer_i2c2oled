Converts all XPM images in a folder to PIX used by MiSTer i2c2oled.

Usage:
XPMToPIX [folder]

If you run XPMToPIX without the folder argument, then XPMToPIX will convert
all XPM files in the folder where XPMToPIX was run from.

You can supply an optional argument -inv, --inv, -invert, --invert. This
will invert the colors making a black pixel white on the display and vice
versa.
