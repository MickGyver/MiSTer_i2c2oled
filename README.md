# 👾 MiSTer_i2c2oled 👾  
  
Just for fun...  
  
This Bash-Script-Add-On uses the MiSTer's **i2c Interface** on the DE10-Nano  
to drive a small SSD1306 OLED Display with 128x64 Pixel showing (currently only) Pictures based on the running core.  
Antonio Villena builds IOBoards with such small OLED Displays and asked for support, so here we are 🙂

### !! WARNING !! 
This Add-On uses the MiSTer's **i2c Bus**. Wrong usage can confuse the MiSTer's **i2c Bus or worse**!  
You need to make sure you use the right **i2c Bus** as the MiSTer has more than one.  
  
Use the command `i2cdetect -l` for detecting the correct i2c-Bus  
and `i2cdetect [I2CBUS]` for detecting the correct **i2c Address** of your Display, normally 0x3C (Hex).  
On my new DE10-Nano (LOT#0521) the correct I2CBUS Number is 2,  
on my older DE10-Nano (LOT#0519) the correct I2CBUS Number is ~~1~~ also 2 (just checked).  
Normally you get an error message if you try to run `i2cdetect` on the wrong Bus.

### How does it work  
When the MiSTer boots up the script `/etc/init.d/S60i2c2oled` is called.  
This script does nothing more than calling the script `/usr/bin/i2c2oled.sh`  
and sent it to the background, but only if `/usr/bin/i2c2oled.sh` is found and is executable.  
The Script `/usr/bin/i2c2oled.sh` uses the Linux `source` command to **load** the Picture Data from file if the core has changed.  
The Script uses the **i2c** command `i2cset` to initialize the Display and calculates the needed values  
out of the loaded Picture Data and send these values via **i2c** to the Display.
  
### Picture Modification:  
The used Black&White Pictures are slightly modfied X-PixMap (XPM) Pictures with 128x64 Pixel.  
You can create X-PixMap Pictures with Gimp.  
After you created the Black&White X-PixMap Picture open it with an Text Editor, I use Notepad++, and do the following:
* Switch to Linux Line Ending (LineFeed only)
* Remove all text lines until the first Data Line which should contain a lot Dot's "." and Spaces like `"... . . . "`
* Add `#!/bin/bash` as the new first line
* Add `logo=(` before the first **"** (double quote) so it should look like `logo=("`
* Replace all Dot's "." with the Number "0"
* Replace all Spaces " " with the Number "1"
* Replace the ending `};` with `)`
* The filename must be the same as the **name of the core** plus `.pix` as extension  
  Example: Corename = **C64**, Filename = **C64.pix**  
* Upload the File(s) to `/media/fat/i2c2oled_pix/` on **MiSTer**
* Have fun 😃  
▶️You can use the [template](https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_i2c2oled/blob/main/Pictures/Pix/template.pix) as well.  
  
Double check the files in https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_i2c2oled/tree/main/Pictures/Pix for correct modification.
  
### Files&Folders  
| File/Folder | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| S60i2c2oled [1] | Starter Script, must be placed in folder `/etc/init.d/` on **MiSTer** |
| i2c2oled [1] | Communication Script, must be placed in folder `/usr/bin/` on **MiSTer** |
| Pictures | Just Pictures |  
| Pictures/Pix | X-PixMap Pictures, slightly modified, must be placed in folder `/media/fat/i2c2oled_pix/` on **MiSTer** |  
  
**Notes**
[1]  
Do not forget to make the two Scripts executable after copying them to the MiSTer.  
Use `chmod +x [scriptname]` for this.
